**AICtrlNet** is an open-core AI orchestration platform that puts humans in the loop.

We believe AI should augment human decision-making, not replace it. AICtrlNet provides the infrastructure for building AI workflows where humans remain in control—reviewing, approving, and guiding AI actions at critical points.

## The Vision

As AI agents become more capable, the question isn't whether to use them—it's how to use them responsibly. AICtrlNet answers that question with:

- **Human-in-the-Loop (HITL)** workflows that require human approval for sensitive actions
- **AI Governance** tools for compliance, audit trails, and risk management
- **Protocol support** for MCP (Model Context Protocol) and A2A (Agent-to-Agent) communication
- **Open core model** with a MIT-licensed Community Edition
